# Changes Made - Real NFT Animation Support

## Summary
Removed all fake animation effects (pulsing, alpha changes) and implemented proper GIF frame extraction to use the **real animations from the NFT contract**.

## Key Changes

### 1. Added GIF Frame Extraction Library
- **File**: `index.html`
- Added `gifuct-js` library to properly parse and extract frames from animated GIFs
- This library works similar to ezgif.com's approach for frame extraction

### 2. Implemented Real Frame Extraction
- **File**: `script.js`
- **New Function**: `extractGifFrames(gifUrl)`
  - Fetches the animated GIF from the NFT's `animationUrl`
  - Uses `gifuct.parseGIF()` to parse the GIF structure
  - Uses `gifuct.decompressFrames()` to extract all individual frames
  - Converts each frame to a canvas data URL for rendering
  - Preserves original frame delays for proper animation timing

### 3. Updated GIF Download Function
- **Function**: `downloadAsGIF()`
- Removed fake pulsing effects
- Now detects animated NFTs and calls `generateRealAnimatedCollage()`
- For static NFTs, creates a simple single-frame GIF

### 4. Updated MP4/Video Download Function
- **Function**: `downloadAsMP4()`
- Removed all fake pulsing/animation effects
- Now detects animated NFTs and calls `generateRealAnimatedVideo()`
- For static NFTs, downloads as PNG instead

### 5. Rewrote Animated Collage Generation
- **Function**: `generateRealAnimatedCollage()`
- Extracts frames from **ALL** animated NFTs in the selection
- Creates a Map of NFT index → extracted frames
- Generates collage frames by combining:
  - Real animation frames from animated NFTs (cycling through their frames)
  - Static images from non-animated NFTs
  - Stable logo in position 0
- Uses original frame delays from the GIFs
- Properly loops shorter animations to match the longest one

### 6. Rewrote Animated Video Generation
- **Function**: `generateRealAnimatedVideo()`
- Extracts frames from all animated NFTs
- Uses MediaRecorder to create WebM video
- Renders each frame at ~30 FPS
- Combines real animation frames with static NFTs
- Loops the animation 2 times for a longer video

### 7. Removed Functions
- Deleted `generateAnimatedVideo()` - had fake pulsing effects
- Deleted `generateAnimatedCollage()` - had fake effects
- Deleted `loadAnimatedNFTFrames()` - didn't actually extract real frames
- Deleted `loadAnimationData()` - created fake pulsing instead of real frames

## How It Works Now

1. **User selects NFTs** (some may be animated GIFs from the contract)
2. **Generates static preview** (PNG canvas)
3. **When downloading as GIF/MP4**:
   - Detects which NFTs have `isAnimated: true` and `animationUrl`
   - Fetches each animated GIF and extracts ALL frames using `gifuct-js`
   - Creates collage frames by combining:
     - Frame 1 of animated NFT 1 + Frame 1 of animated NFT 2 + static NFTs
     - Frame 2 of animated NFT 1 + Frame 2 of animated NFT 2 + static NFTs
     - ... and so on
   - Shorter animations loop to match the longest one
   - Combines all frames into a final animated GIF or video

## Result
✅ **No fake effects** - only real animations from the NFT contract
✅ **Proper frame extraction** - using industry-standard GIF parsing
✅ **Multiple animated NFTs** - all animations play simultaneously in the collage
✅ **Preserved timing** - uses original frame delays from the GIFs
